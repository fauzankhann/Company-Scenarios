# decide-for-company
This Java program gives you an experience of being a decision-maker in a company.

This program will present you with multiple real-life scenarios that companies face, and you are responsible for making strong decisions. You get to choose a company size of your choice (startup, midsize, or well-established) and every decision will have an impact on the company's position. The  goal is to make sure the company has an appropriate amount of revenue, expenses, employees and inventory to keep running (or else the program will end).
